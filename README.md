# Hackathon Schedule Template
Simple, responsive schedule template for hackathons. Built on Angular.js, it takes in a schedule and displays it in a nicely formatted list.

## Features
* Reads in schedule data from a JSON file (you can even use an online JSON host such as [Jasonbase](https://www.jasonbase.com/) for fast editing).
* Supports one-day, two-day and three-day schedules.
* Displays a countdown timer that counts to both starting time and ending time.
* Navigation bar for easier access to Devpost, Slack, etc.
* Responsive, works on mobile!

## Demo
